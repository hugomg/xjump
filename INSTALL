FALLING TOWER Version 2 Installation Manual

(C) July 17, 1997 ROYALPANDA


## Requirements
===============

* A xpm library is required
* An user named "games", to own the highscores file. (I think its standard)

## How to Install
=================

The instalation procedures are a bit different depending on whether you
want to install for all users or just yourself.

### System install
------------------

1. Edit the Makefile if you want to change some settings.

2. Compile the xjump binary

        % make

3. Install xjump

        % sudo make install

### Local install
-----------------

1. Edit the Makefile to point the highscores file to
   somewhere you control.
   For example, /home/hogehoge/xjump_record/record

2. Compile the xjump binary

        % make

3. Finally, install the game

        % install -c -s -m 4755 xjump ~hogehoge/bin
        % mkdir ~hogehoge/xjump_record
        % touch ~hogehoge/xjump_record/record

## Important considerations:
============================

In order to make sure the highscores are recorded:

* The location of the highscores file is statically assigned to the binary
  during compilation. You must make sure that that file exists.
* The xjump binary and the highscores file must have the same owner.
* Make sure the setuid/setgid bits are correctly set in the binary
