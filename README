## How to run xjump
===================

xjump [-toolkitoption] [-graphic "graph_file"] [-keymap] [-help]

        -graphic  Specify a custom graphics file (see below)

        -keymap   Read the keyboard keycodes directly (see below)

        -help     Show this help message

## Game controls
================

        shift-Q : Exit game
        P       : Pause / Resume
        
        You can move sideways arrow keys, keypad keys and mouse buttons
        You can jump with the up arrow keys, Z, SPACE
        
## Custom keybindings
=====================

Keybindings can be configured via X resource files.
YOu can use the following actions in XJump*game.translation:

    start()
    pause()
    quit()

    key_on(key)
    key_off(key)

When the -keymap option is specified, xjump reads the
keyboard state directly and ignores the key_on and key_off
events from X.This is useful for X servers that do not support
key-release events.

## Custom graphics
==================

Xjump can use custom textures in xpm format. The required dimensions are 144x64.

In the following diagram, each letter represents a 16x16 pixel area.
