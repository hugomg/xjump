# FALLING TOWER Version 2.8

FALLING TOWER is a game where you jump up and up while the tower collapses under your feet.

## Installation

Install xjump using the usual configure + make install pattern:

    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
    
Run `./configure -- help` for a list of configuration options to tweak install locations, etc.
    
To allow xjump to update the highscore file on behalf of regular user, your system must have a user and group namd `games`.
We expect this to be standard in Linux distributions.
